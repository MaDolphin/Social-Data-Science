    "Recall the _Ricci_ dataset that we have discussed in lecture, which shows the results of an exam for promotion eligibility. For the purpose of this exercise, we want to build a classifier which achieves that the group that gets a promoted (_Class_ attribute) is fairly balanced with respect to the sensitive attribute *Race* - as noted in lecture, enforcing this equality on that data has actually caused a \"reverse discrimination\" lawsuit. The majority class, i.e. the white population, has sensitive attribute value 1, and all non-whites have sensitive attribute value 0.\n",

    "#### c) The Two Naive Bayes Algorithm by Calders and Verwer (1 pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture we have briefly touched the Two Naive Bayes algorithm by Calders and Verwer. Its main idea is to train two different Naive Bayes models corresponding to both values of a binary sensitive attribute $S$, and to then adapt the prior probabilities $P(Y|S)$ of each of these models until the predictions on the training data become fair.\n",
    "More precisely, in training, we first fit two different models, namely one for the privileged class $S=1$ and one for the non-privileged class $S=0$, to obtain the conditional probabilities $P(X_i|Y,S=s)$, $s=0,1$, and the priors $P(Y|S=s)$, $s=0,1$ from the training data. After these initial fits, we evaluate the model on the training data, and if we do not observe fair predictions, i.e. predictions for which the CV score is at least $1-\\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon>0$, we adapt the priors $P(Y|S=s)$ until this is the case. This adaptation is carried out as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize $N(Y=j, S=s)$ as the number of training samples with class $j$ and sensitive attribute value $s$, and $N(Y=1)$ the number of samples with class $1$ in the data. Further, let $\\Delta$ denote an adaptation rate, which is given as input.  \n",
    "Then we conduct the following iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "     cv_score <- CV score of the predicted classes by the current model.\n",
    "     while cv_score < 1 - \\epsilon:\n",

    "           N(Y=1, S=1) <- N(Y=1, S=1) - ΔN(Y=1, S=0)\n",
    "        if any of the N(Y, S) is negative then cancel the previous update of N(Y, S) and abort\n",
    "        Recalculate priors P(Y|S=i)  and cv_score based on updated N(Y, S)\n",
    "    \n",
