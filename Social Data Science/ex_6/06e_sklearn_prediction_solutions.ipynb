    "\n",
    "In lecture we have focused on the binary case in classification. However, in many applications there are more than two classes to predict.  \n",
    "One standard strategy to extend binary classification methods to the multiclass case is the so-called _one-vs-all_ approach, which requires a classifier that can also produce a confidence score for its predictions rather than the crisp predictions themselves. In logistic regression for instance, such a confidence score is given by the class probabilities.  \n",
    "Assuming that you there are $L$ classes $C_1,\\dots, C_L$, in the one-vs-all approach one fits $L$ binary models where in the $l$-th model the goal is to predict whether a sample belongs to class $C_l$ or not. After fitting the $l$-th model, the confidence score of each sample belonging to class $C_l$ is then computed and stored, and in the end, the class that achieved the highest confidence score among all $L$ classes is then chosen as the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we are going to implement this approach and apply it on a student evaluation dataset, aiming to predict which of three course instructors has given a class. The dataset is loaded in the cell below, and documented on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/turkiye+student+evaluation. Feel free to explore the data beforehand. Note that we drop the class (lecture) identifier, since this uniquely determines the instructors."
