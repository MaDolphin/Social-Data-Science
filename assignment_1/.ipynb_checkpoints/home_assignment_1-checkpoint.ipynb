    "#### Coding guidelines:\n",
    "* Make sure that your code is executable, any task for which the code does directly not run on our machine will be graded with 0 points.\n",
    "* In that regard, do not rename the dataset you use, and load it from the same directory that your ipynb-notebook is located in, i.e., your working directory. In particular, when loading your file via a pandas or numpy command, make sure that it has the form `pd.read_csv(\"qog_file.csv\")` instead of `pd.read_csv(\"C:/User/Path/to/your/Homework/qog_file.csv\")` so that the code directly works from our machines.\n",
    "* Make sure you clean up your code before submission, e.g., properly align your code, and delete every line of code that you do not need anymore, even if you may have experimented with it\n",
    "* Feel free to use comments in the code. While we do not require them to get full marks, they may help us in case your code has minor errors\n",
    "* You may create as many additional cells as you want, just make sure that the solutions to the individual tasks can be found near the corresponding assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plotting guidelines:\n",
    "* For both visualization tasks, you may only create ONE graphic. Thus, if you want to convey much information, think properly about how you can approach this. If you have more than one visualization per task, we will only count the LAST one. You may however use auxiliary plots or textual outputs to illustrate how you came to your final plot. \n",
    "* To get full marks for your plots, we require that you consider the principles taught in lecture. In particular, your plot and the message they convey should be easy to understand. No chart-junk. Optimize the data to ink ratio!\n",
    "* Write a brief summary (<=5 sentences) of your plot in a markdown cell directly below it. \n",
    "* Make sure you also pay attention to details such as properly calibrated axes, understandable labels, properly placed legends, etc."
